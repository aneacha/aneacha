## About me

💼 I’m currently working in a bank in risk modelling, while developing projects to strengthen my skills in data.

🎓 I have studied the Máster Big Data, Data Science & Inteligencia Artificial at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).

🧠 In the master, I have gained experience in Linux & Git, SQL databases, Business Intelligence (Tableau), Python programming, NoSQL, statistics, data mining & predictive modelling, machine learning, advanced data visualization, deep learning & AI, Big Data technologies (Spark, Hadoop), model deployment, and applied data science for business.

🔐 I have completed a Cybersecurity Bootcamp (The Bridge), where I learned cybersecurity fundamentals, tools, exploitation labs and practical exercises.
